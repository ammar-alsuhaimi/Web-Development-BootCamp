**Life in Weeks Coding Exercise**

I was reading this article by [Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html) and realised just how little time we actually have.

In this challenge, you are going to create a function that tells us how many days, weeks and months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

It will take your current age as the input and console.logs a message with our time left in this format:

_You have x days, y weeks, and z months left._

Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

For this challenge, assume there are **365** days in a year, **52** weeks in a year and **12** months in a year.

**IMPORTANT** your **console.log** output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

**Example Input**

e.g. If you are 56 years old:

1. lifeInWeeks(56)

**Example Output**

1. You have 12410 days, 1768 weeks, and 408 months left.

**Hint**

1. Try using [this Repl.it playground](https://repl.it/@appbrewery/Age-In-Weeks-Challenge) to test your code and see if the output is what you expect it to be.
2. Make sure your console.log output matches the example output precisely. The same capitalisation, the same spaces, commas and full stops.

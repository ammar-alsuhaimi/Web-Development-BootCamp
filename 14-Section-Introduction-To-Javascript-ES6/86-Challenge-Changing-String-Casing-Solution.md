**Recap of the Key Steps:**

1. **Store User Input**: Use prompt() to get the user's name.
2. **Isolate the First Character**: Using slice(0, 1) to get just the first character of the name.
3. **Uppercase the First Character**: Apply .toUpperCase() on the first character.
4. **Get the Rest of the Name**: Use slice(1) to grab the remaining characters from the name.
5. **Lowercase the Rest**: Ensure the rest of the characters are lowercase using .toLowerCase().
6. **Concatenate**: Combine the capitalized first character with the rest of the name.
7. **Edge Case Handling**: If the user enters a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, normalize it by lowercasing the entire rest of the name.

The solution is thorough and flexible, addressing the potential issue of users entering a mix of cases.

Hereâ€™s the final version of the code, which handles the edge case (where the user might enter capital letters in the middle or end of the name):

var name = prompt("What is your name?");

var firstChar = name.slice(0, 1); // Get first character

var upperCaseFirstChar = firstChar.toUpperCase(); // Capitalize first character

var restOfName = name.slice(1).toLowerCase(); // Get the rest of the name and make it lowercase

var capitalizedName = upperCaseFirstChar + restOfName; // Combine them

alert("Hello, " + capitalizedName); // Display the greeting with capitalized name

**Summary of Enhancements:**

- **Handling mixed cases** by lowercasing the rest of the name ensures that inputs like aNGELA or AngELA are properly formatted.
- The **step-by-step approach** to problem-solving is the real takeaway here, especially for beginners. By isolating each part and tackling it one by one, it becomes easier to spot potential issues and fix them.

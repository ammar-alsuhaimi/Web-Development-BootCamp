**Summary of Coding Exercise: Switching Variable Values**

**Goal:**

- You are tasked with switching the values of two variables, a and b, without directly assigning the new values.
- Initially, a = 3 and b = 8. After switching, a should hold the value 8, and b should hold the value 3.

**Rules & Constraints:**

1. **Do Not Change Existing Code:**
    - You are not allowed to modify any code outside the lines where you're instructed to write your solution (lines 7, 8, and 9).
2. **Do Not Use Numbers Directly:**
    - You cannot assign specific values like a = 8 and b = 3. You must use the variables themselves to achieve the switch.
3. **Do Not Re-Declare Variables:**
    - You cannot redeclare the variables (a and b) by assigning new values directly. For example, a = "8" and b = "3" would be wrong.

**Objective:**

- Think of the problem as having two buckets (a and b). a contains sand and b contains water, and you need to switch the contents of these two buckets.
- The solution will involve some clever use of temporary storage or manipulation of the variables themselves.

**How to Test:**

- Use a **code playground** to write and test your solution.
- After writing your solution, run the code to check if it outputs:
  - a = 8
  - b = 3

**Steps:**

1. **Understand the problem**: You need to swap the values of a and b without violating the constraints.
2. **Write the code**: You will need to fill in lines 7, 8, and 9 to solve the problem.
3. **Test your solution**: Use the provided playground to test your code.

**Solution Verification:**

- Once you've implemented the solution, click on **Check Solution** to see if you've successfully swapped the values of the variables.

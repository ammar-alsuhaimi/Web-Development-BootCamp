# JavaScript String Length and Twitter Character Count

## Introduction
Another really cool feature of JavaScript strings is that we can easily figure out the number of characters in a string by simply tapping into its "length" property. So we can simply write `word.length`, and we'll be able to get the number of characters inside the word.

## Example
Let me show it to you in practice. Let's head over to our Chrome Snippets.

```javascript
let name = "Angela";
console.log(name.length); // Output: 6
```

As you can see, the length of the string "Angela" is 6.

## Twitter Character Count
In the previous version of Twitter, you had only 140 characters that you could use in order to create a tweet. As you were writing the tweet, you would get a count of how many characters you've used and how many characters you have remaining, and your tweet would get cut off at 140 characters.

Now, Twitter has decided to increase the character count to 280, but I kind of preferred it when it was only 140 characters. I find that 280 is a little bit too long, and people end up writing mini essays instead of what it should be, which is kind of one or two sentences.

## Challenge
Here's a slightly harder challenge: write some JavaScript code to create a prompt where the user can enter a long string such as a paragraph of text from a blog post. You will tell them how many characters they have written and also how many characters they have remaining out of either 140 or 280 characters.

### Example Output
The output should be something like:
```
You have written 182 characters, you have -42 characters left.
```

This challenge involves some concatenation, a little bit of math, and what you have learned about the `length` property.

### Solution
Here's how you can code up the Twitter character count:

```javascript
// Prompt the user to compose a tweet
let tweet = prompt("Compose your tweet");

// Get the length of the tweet
let tweetCount = tweet.length;

// Create an alert with the character count and remaining characters
alert("You have written " + tweetCount + " characters, you have " + (140 - tweetCount) + " characters remaining.");
```

## Comments in JavaScript
To comment out code in JavaScript:
- Single-line comment: `//`
- Multi-line comment: `/* ... */`

### Example
```javascript
// Single-line comment
let singleLineComment = "This is a single-line comment";

/*
 Multi-line comment
 This is a multi-line comment
*/
let multiLineComment = "This is a multi-line comment";
```

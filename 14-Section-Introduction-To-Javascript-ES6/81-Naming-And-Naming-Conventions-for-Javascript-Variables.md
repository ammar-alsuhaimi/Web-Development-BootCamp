**1\. The Importance of Naming Variables Meaningfully:**

- Variables should have descriptive names that clearly indicate what they store.
- Bad names, like struggles_to_pronounce, make code harder to understand and maintain.
- Think of naming variables like organizing folders on your desktop. Proper names like "Pictures" or "Documents" make it easier to find what you're looking for, just as good variable names help others understand your code faster.

**2\. Rules for Valid Variable Names:**

- **Avoid JavaScript Keywords:** You can't name variables after reserved words (e.g., var, function). For instance, var is invalid as a variable name.
- **No Leading Numbers:** You can't start a variable name with a number, e.g., 123abc is invalid, but abc123 is fine.
- **No Spaces:** Variable names cannot contain spaces. For example, my name is invalid, but myName is valid.
- **Allowed Characters:** Only letters, numbers, underscores (\_), and dollar signs ($) are allowed. You can't use hyphens (-) in variable names, so my-name is invalid, but my_name is valid.

**3\. Camel Casing Convention:**

- **Camel Case** is a standard naming convention where the first word is lowercase, and each subsequent word starts with a capital letter.
- For example: myVariableName, userAge, totalPrice.
- This avoids confusion, as in the example of **TherapistFinder.com**, which could be misread as "The rapist Finder."

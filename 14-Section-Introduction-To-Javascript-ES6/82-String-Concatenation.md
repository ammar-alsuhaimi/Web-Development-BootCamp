**Working with Strings and Concatenation**

**1\. String Concatenation:**

- Strings can be combined using the + operator. This process is called **concatenation**.
- Example: "a" + " " + "b" results in the string "a b".
- **Concatenation** joins the content inside the quotation marks, ignoring everything outside.

**2\. Creating a Greeting Message:**

- You can create a personalized greeting by using variables for dynamic content.
- For example:
- var message = "Hello";
- var name = "John"; // You can also use a prompt to get the user's name
- alert(message + " " + name);
- This will pop up an alert saying, for example, "Hello John".

**3\. Challenge:**

- Create two variables:
  - message = "Hello"
  - name = user's name (either hardcoded or via prompt).
- Use concatenation to combine these variables and display the greeting in an alert.

**4\. Common Ways to Add Space:**

- You can add a space by including it directly in the string: "Hello " + name
- Alternatively, you can use a separate string for the space: "Hello" + " " + name.

**Summary:**

- **Concatenation** helps in joining multiple strings together.
- You can use variables in string concatenation to create dynamic and personalized messages.
- Be mindful of adding spaces between concatenated strings.

This is a great challenge to get hands-on experience with functions and Karel the robot. 
Here’s how we can approach the tasks step by step:

**Task 1: Moving Karel to the top-right corner of a 5x5 world**

We want Karel to start in the bottom-left corner (position 1,1) and move to the top-right corner (position 5,5).

**Approach:**

1. **Move Karel 4 steps right** (to reach the top-right corner horizontally).
2. **Turn Karel left** to face upwards.
3. **Move Karel 4 steps up** to reach the top-right corner vertically.

**Code:**

function moveFourTimes() {

move();

move();

move();

move();

}

function main() {

moveFourTimes(); // Move 4 steps right

turnLeft(); // Turn left to face upward

moveFourTimes(); // Move 4 steps up

}

This code uses the moveFourTimes() function to reduce repetition. When run, Karel will move to the top-right corner.

**Task 2: Placing a diagonal line of beepers**

Karel should place a beeper at each diagonal position from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner.

**Approach:**

1. Karel will move diagonally and place a beeper at each step.
2. To move diagonally, Karel will move one step, turn left, move another step, then place a beeper.

**Code:**

function diagonalMoveAndBeeper() {

move(); // Move 1 step

turnLeft(); // Turn left

move(); // Move 1 more step

putBeeper(); // Place a beeper

turnLeft(); // Turn to the right again

}

function main() {

putBeeper(); // Place the first beeper

diagonalMoveAndBeeper(); // First diagonal move and beeper

diagonalMoveAndBeeper(); // Second diagonal move and beeper

diagonalMoveAndBeeper(); // Third diagonal move and beeper

diagonalMoveAndBeeper(); // Fourth diagonal move and beeper

}

This code defines diagonalMoveAndBeeper(), which makes Karel move diagonally and place a beeper. It’s called multiple times to create a diagonal line of beepers from bottom-left to top-right.

**Task 3: Optional challenge – Creating a chessboard pattern**

For the optional challenge, Karel is asked to create a chessboard pattern, alternating beepers across the grid.

**Approach:**

1. Karel moves in a zigzag pattern, placing a beeper or leaving it, alternating each time.
2. Each row of the grid will alternate between starting with a beeper and leaving the first spot empty.

**Code (for 5x5 grid):**

function moveAndPlaceBeeper() {

move();

putBeeper();

}

function moveAndSkip() {

move();

}

function main() {

// Row 1

putBeeper();

moveAndSkip();

moveAndPlaceBeeper();

moveAndSkip();

moveAndPlaceBeeper();

// Move to the next row

turnLeft();

move();

turnLeft();

// Row 2

moveAndSkip();

moveAndPlaceBeeper();

moveAndSkip();

moveAndPlaceBeeper();

moveAndSkip();

}

In this code, Karel places beepers in an alternating pattern. You can expand this pattern for more rows and columns by repeating the same logic for each row and adjusting where Karel starts.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Functions** help reduce repetition by packaging code that can be reused.
- **Parameters**: Next, we can explore adding parameters to functions to make them even more flexible.
- Karel the robot is a fun and interactive way to practice writing functions that automate repetitive tasks!

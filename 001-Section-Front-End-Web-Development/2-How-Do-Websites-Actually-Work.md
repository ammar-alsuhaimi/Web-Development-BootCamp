## How Websites Work

### 1. Introduction
- The Internet consists of wires connecting client computers with server computers.
- DNS (Domain Name Service) servers act as a phonebook, looking up IP addresses of websites.

### 2. Types of Files
- Websites consist of three types of files: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **HTML**: Responsible for the content of the website (e.g., text, images, buttons).
- **CSS**: Determines the styling of the website (e.g., colors, fonts, shapes).
- **JavaScript**: Provides functionality and interactivity (e.g., sending emails, posting on social media).

### 3. Example: Google Home Page
- HTML provides the structure and content (e.g., logo, buttons, text box).
- CSS applies styling to these elements (e.g., shapes, colors).
- JavaScript adds functionality (e.g., search capability).

### 4. Using Chrome Developer Tools
- Chrome Developer Tools allow you to inspect and edit elements on a web page.
- You can change the content of a website locally, but changes are not saved when the page is refreshed.
- This is a useful way to understand the structure and styling of web pages.

### 5. Creating Your Own Websites
- By learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can create and host your own websites.
- You'll be able to design websites to look and function the way you want.

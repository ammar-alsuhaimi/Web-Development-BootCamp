2. Install Visual Studio Code Extensions
Extensions are like plugins that extend the functionality of VSCode. Here are the ones that I've installed. Click on the link and then click on the "install" button and it should automatically install it in your VSCode application.

3. Install Google Chrome
This is a free browser from Google that we need for development. Even if you normally use another browser, I recommend downloading Chrome for their developer tool suite which we will use extensively in the course.

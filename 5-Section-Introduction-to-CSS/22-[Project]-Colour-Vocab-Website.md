\### Project Overview: Building a Spanish Vocabulary Flashcard Website

\*\*Objective:\*\* Create a website to help users learn the Spanish names for colors by displaying words and corresponding images.

\### Steps:

1\. \*\*Set Up Files:\*\*

\- Download the Color Vocab Project starting files.

\- Open the project in VS Code.

\- Create a \`style.css\` file and link it to \`index.html\`.

2\. \*\*Initial CSS Check:\*\*

\- Verify that the \`style.css\` file is properly linked by setting a background color to red.

3\. \*\*Styling with CSS:\*\*

\- \*\*Match Text Color with Meaning:\*\*

\- Assign colors to the text based on their meanings (e.g., \`rojo\` should be red, \`azul\` should be blue, etc.).

\- Use IDs to target each color and set the appropriate text color.

\- \*\*Set Font Weight:\*\*

\- Select all h2 elements with the class \`color-title\` and set their \`font-weight\` to normal.

\- \*\*Square Images:\*\*

\- Ensure all images are 200px by 200px using CSS (not HTML).

4\. \*\*Customization:\*\*

\- Optionally, personalize the website by changing colors, words, or adding additional styling.

\### Additional Notes:

\- Do not change anything in \`index.html\`.

\- Use the steps in the TODOs or refer to \`goal.png\` for guidance.

\- Preview the solution by opening \`solution.html\` in the browser.

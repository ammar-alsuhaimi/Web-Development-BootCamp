In this project, you're going to build your 

**first Web Developer Portfolio**,
a simple HTML-only website where you showcase your work. 

This will serve as a platform for potential employers or clients to see what you've built. 

Here are the key steps:

1. **Taking Screenshots**: Capture screenshots of your previous projects (e.g., the Movie Ranking and Birthday Invite Projects) to include as previews on your portfolio. 
You can search online for how to take screenshots on your system (Windows, Mac, or Linux).

2. **Portfolio Files**: Download and extract the Portfolio Project zip file, and open it in VS Code. 

The folder contains files like movie-ranking.html and birthday-invite.html with your project code. 

Customize these files by adding your own code, updating project details, and modifying personal information.

3. **Setting Up the HTML Boilerplate**: Follow what you learned from the last lesson to create a basic HTML boilerplate. 
Make sure to update the title and any other necessary details.

4. **Adding Project Links and Images**:
    - Add the links to your previous projects (e.g., using anchor tags for the Movie Ranking and Birthday Invite pages).
    - Add screenshots as images in the portfolio. 
    Use the height attribute to ensure they display correctly and don’t take up too much space.

5. **Creating "About Me" and "Contact Me" Pages**: These pages will go at the bottom of your portfolio, providing visitors with more information about you. 
You can use horizontal rules or other HTML elements to separate sections and organize your content.

6. **Seven Tasks**: There are seven to-dos to follow to complete the project. 
This will guide you through each step of setting up your portfolio, from creating the HTML boilerplate to adding the necessary content and images.

7. **Customization and Creativity**: This is your portfolio, so feel free to be creative. 
You can add any extra elements or change the layout however you like. 
Make sure the structure and code are clear and well-organized.

At the end, you’ll have a simple yet professional-looking portfolio that showcases your work and can be shared with others.

**Hosting Your Website on GitHub Pages**

**web hosting** and how to make your portfolio website live on the Internet using **GitHub Pages**. 
This will allow you to share your work with anyone around the world.

**What is Web Hosting?**

Web hosting is the process of making your website available online so that people from anywhere can access it. 
This is done by **uploading your website files (HTML, images, etc.) to a web server** that is connected to the Internet and operates 24/7.

Currently, you can only view your website **locally** on your computer. 
To make it accessible worldwide, we need to host it online.

**Steps to Host Your Portfolio Website on GitHub Pages**

**1\. Create a GitHub Repository**

- Go to [**GitHub**](https://github.com/) and **sign up** or **log in**.
- Click the **“+”** button in the top-right corner and select **“New Repository”**.
- Name it **html-portfolio** and set it to **Public**.
- Check the option to **Add a README file** and click **Create Repository**.

**2\. Upload Your Website Files**

- In your repository, click **"Add File" → "Upload Files"**.
- Navigate to your **portfolio project folder** and upload **all contents** (not the entire folder, just the files inside).
- Ensure you have:  
    ✅ index.html (must be named exactly this, as it serves as the homepage).  
    ✅ images folder (containing your project previews).  
    ✅ public folder (containing movie-ranking.html and birthday-invite.html).
- Click **"Commit changes"** to save the files.

**3\. Enable GitHub Pages**

- Go to your repository’s **Settings** → **Pages**.
- Under **Branch**, change from **None** to **Main** and click **Save**.

the concept of **file paths** is introduced, which are used to locate files and folders on a computer. 
There are two main types of file paths: **absolute** and **relative**.

- **Absolute File Path**: This path is based on the root directory (like C: drive on Windows or Macintosh HD on Mac). 
It specifies the exact location of a file from the root of the system.
- **Relative File Path**: This path is based on the location of the current file, and it's more commonly used in web development. 
It allows you to navigate within your project directory structure, making it easier to reference resources like images.

using **relative file paths** for web development because they are shorter and more flexible, especially when moving files around in your project. 
Special characters like **./** (current directory) and **../** (up one directory) are introduced for navigating through the file structure.

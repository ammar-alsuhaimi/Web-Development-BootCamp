**1\. Introduction and Context**

- **Purpose:**  
    Apply the four pillars of web design (Color Theory, Typography, UI Design, UX Design) to create a complete website design.
- **Inspiration:**
  - Mention of Daily UI challenges and Collect UI as sources of inspiration.
  - Emphasis on repeated practice to build design skills.

**2\. Project Overview: Designing a Hotel Website**

- **Concept:**
  - Create a website design for a hotel using Canva.
  - The hotel is given the placeholder name "A Hotel."
- **Design Vision:**
  - A modern, visually appealing, multi-page website.
  - Includes a title/hero section, a features page, and a contact page.
- **Tools:**
  - Use Canva (an online graphic design tool) to set custom dimensions (e.g., 1400px by 800px).
  - Leverage free templates, images, SVG icons, and design elements available on Canva.

**3\. Step-by-Step Design Process**

**A. Title (Hero) Screen**

- **Set Up the Canvas:**
  - Create a new design with custom dimensions (1400px width x 800px height).
- **Background:**
  - Apply a free template for texture.
  - Replace or overlay the template with a full-bleed background image (e.g., a beach photo).
- **Design Elements:**
  - Add abstract shapes (e.g., circles, squares) and adjust their positioning.
  - Change element colors (e.g., use white for certain shapes) to establish a color palette.
- **Typography and Text:**
  - Add a large heading with the hotel’s name ("A Hotel").
  - Change the heading typeface to a serif font (e.g., Cardo) for an established look.
  - Set the color of the heading to white and adjust size, letter spacing, and capitalization.
  - Add a subheading or tagline (e.g., "Lose yourself to find yourself") using a contrasting sans-serif font (e.g., Glacial Indifference).
- **Alignment:**
  - Use Canva’s alignment grids to center text and shapes precisely.

**B. Features Page**

- **Layout:**
  - Create a new page that will showcase key features of the hotel.
- **Images:**
  - Insert three images (e.g., a bedroom, a breakfast setting, and a pool).
  - Crop and resize images so that they are uniform in size and evenly spaced.
- **Design Enhancements:**
  - Add framing elements (e.g., a circle around a square image) to give a modern, contemporary feel.
- **Text and Copy:**
  - Add subheadings for each feature (e.g., "Beautiful Rooms," "Delicious Food," "Relaxing Pool").
  - Include brief body text (use generated Lorem Ipsum if needed), ensuring consistency in font choice and alignment.
- **Consistency:**
  - Ensure all images, frames, and text blocks are aligned (using the grid and Canva’s guides) to create a tidy, balanced look.
- **Color Palette and Spacing:**
  - Maintain a consistent color scheme (greens, turquoise, blue, and white).
  - Use proper spacing (adjust margins and padding via Canva’s tools) so elements are not cluttered.

**C. Contact Page**

- **Background and Imagery:**
  - Choose a suitable background image (e.g., a contemporary tropical photo such as a pineapple).
  - Resize and position the image appropriately so that only a portion is visible.
- **Text Content:**
  - Add a title for the contact section (e.g., “Stay”).
  - Include contact details such as a mailing address, email, and phone number.
- **Design Elements:**
  - Use geometric shapes (for example, a hexagon) to frame or highlight contact information.
  - Adjust alignment to ensure that text and images are right-aligned or positioned in a consistent vertical column.
- **Final Touches:**
  - Fine-tune the spacing between elements to maintain visual balance.

**4\. Publishing and Feedback**

- **Publish the Design:**
  - Use Canva’s publish feature to generate a web link for your design.
  - Preview the design as a full webpage to check consistency across the three pages.
- **Gather Feedback:**
  - Share the link with peers or mentors to receive comments on your design.
  - Reflect on how well you applied the four pillars of design.

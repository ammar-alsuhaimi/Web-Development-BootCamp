# Enhancing Button Interactivity: Playing Drum Sounds on Click

 Now, let's enhance our application by playing specific drum sounds when each button is clicked.

## Playing Audio in JavaScript

To play audio in JavaScript, you can create a new `Audio` object and call its `play()` method. Here's how:

```javascript
var audio = new Audio('sounds/tom-1.mp3');
audio.play();
```

This code creates a new audio object for the file `tom-1.mp3` located in the `sounds` directory and plays it.

## Implementing Sound Playback on Button Clicks

We want each button to play a specific drum sound when clicked. To achieve this:

1. **Assign Background Images to Buttons**

   First, let's assign background images to each button to represent different drums. In your `styles.css`, you can add:

   ```css
   .w { background-image: url('images/tom1.png'); }
   .a { background-image: url('images/tom2.png'); }
   .s { background-image: url('images/tom3.png'); }
   .d { background-image: url('images/tom4.png'); }
   .j { background-image: url('images/snare.png'); }
   .k { background-image: url('images/crash.png'); }
   .l { background-image: url('images/kick.png'); }
   ```

   Ensure that the class names correspond to the text content of your buttons and that the image paths are correct.

2. **Add Event Listeners to Buttons**

   In your `index.js`, add event listeners to all buttons:

   ```javascript
   var numberOfDrumButtons = document.querySelectorAll(".drum").length;

   for (var i = 0; i < numberOfDrumButtons; i++) {
       document.querySelectorAll(".drum")[i].addEventListener("click", function() {
           var buttonInnerHTML = this.innerHTML;
           makeSound(buttonInnerHTML);
       });
   }
   ```

   Here, we loop through all elements with the class `drum` and add a click event listener to each. When a button is clicked, it triggers the `makeSound` function with the button's inner HTML as an argument.

3. **Define the `makeSound` Function**

   Now, define the `makeSound` function to play the corresponding sound:

   ```javascript
   function makeSound(key) {
       switch (key) {
           case "w":
               var tom1 = new Audio('sounds/tom-1.mp3');
               tom1.play();
               break;
           case "a":
               var tom2 = new Audio('sounds/tom-2.mp3');
               tom2.play();
               break;
           case "s":
               var tom3 = new Audio('sounds/tom-3.mp3');
               tom3.play();
               break;
           case "d":
               var tom4 = new Audio('sounds/tom-4.mp3');
               tom4.play();
               break;
           case "j":
               var snare = new Audio('sounds/snare.mp3');
               snare.play();
               break;
           case "k":
               var crash = new Audio('sounds/crash.mp3');
               crash.play();
               break;
           case "l":
               var kick = new Audio('sounds/kick-bass.mp3');
               kick.play();
               break;
           default: console.log(key);
       }
   }
   ```

   This function uses a `switch` statement to match the button's inner HTML (which corresponds to a specific key) and plays the associated sound.

## Understanding the `this` Keyword in Event Listeners

In the context of event listeners, the `this` keyword refers to the element that received the event. For example, in our event listener:

```javascript
document.querySelectorAll(".drum")[i].addEventListener("click", function() {
    var buttonInnerHTML = this.innerHTML;
    makeSound(buttonInnerHTML);
});
```

Here, `this` refers to the button element that was clicked, allowing us to access its `innerHTML` to determine which sound to play. It's important to note that if you use an arrow function (`() => {}`) instead of a regular function (`function() {}`), `this` would not refer to the clicked element but rather inherit from the parent scope. Therefore, using a regular function is essential in this context to ensure `this` refers to the element that triggered the event. citeturn0search1

By implementing these steps, each button in your application will now play its corresponding drum sound when clicked, providing an interactive experience for users.

# Introduction to the Drum Kit Project

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Learn intermediate/advanced parts of the Document Object Model (DOM) by building a Drum Kit website.
- **End Goal**: 
  - Add event listeners to buttons and keystrokes.
  - Respond to user actions (keyboard taps and button clicks) on your website.
  - Impress your friends with a fantastic, functional website.

## How It Works
- **Keys & Sounds**:
  - The website will have a number of keys representing different drums in a typical drum set.
  - Clicking on any button will produce the corresponding drum sound.
  - You can also use keyboard keys to trigger the sounds.

- **Excitement**:
  - Every time a terrible programming joke is cracked, you can now give a drum roll!

## Learning Outcomes
- **Event Listeners**:
  - Learn to add event listeners to buttons and keystrokes.
  - Detect user interactions on your website and respond to them.
  
- **Cool Website**:
  - Build an awesome website to showcase and impress your friends.

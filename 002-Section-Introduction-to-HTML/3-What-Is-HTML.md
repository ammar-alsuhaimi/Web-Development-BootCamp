### What is HTML?
HTML (**HyperText Markup Language**) is the foundation of web development, defining the content and structure of a website. 
Web browsers like Chrome and Safari interpret HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to render web pages, but a website can exist with just an HTML file.

### Key Points:
- **Markup Language**: Uses tags to define elements like headings (`h1`-`h6`) and paragraphs (`p`). 
- **Structure**: It organizes content hierarchically, making it easy to read and navigate.
- **Content**: HTML focuses on the presentation of text, images, and links, but does not handle logic or interactivity (that's where CSS and JavaScript come in).

### Example of Basic HTML
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Example Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to HTML</h1>
    <p>This is a simple paragraph.</p>
    <a href="https://example.com">Click here to visit a website</a>
</body>
</html>
```

- **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**: Declares the document as HTML5.
- **`<html>`**: The root element that contains all other HTML elements.
- **`<head>`**: Contains meta-information about the document, like its title.
- **`<body>`**: Contains the actual content of the web page, such as headings and paragraphs.

HTML is the foundation of web development, and mastering it is the first step to creating structured, well-organized web pages.

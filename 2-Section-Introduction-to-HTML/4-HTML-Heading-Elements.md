# Introduction to HTML Heading Elements

HTML heading elements are used to define headings on a web page. Headings are important for organizing content and making it easily readable. 
They range from <h1> to <h6>, with <h1> being the highest (or most important) level and <h6> the lowest. 
similar to a book's table of contents.

## Key Concepts:
### Tags

*   **Definition**: Tags are the basic building blocks of HTML. 
They are used to create elements.
    
*   **Syntax**: Tags are written within angle brackets < >.
    
*   **Types**: There are opening tags and closing tags.
    
    *   **Opening Tag**:<tagname>
        
    *   **Closing Tag**:</tagname>
        
*   **Example**:
    
    <p> is an opening tag for a paragraph, and
    
    </p> is the closing tag for the same paragraph.
    

### Elements

*   **Definition**: An element consists of the opening tag, content (if any), and the closing tag.
    
*   **Role**: Elements represent the structure and content of the web page.
    
*   **Syntax**: An element is a combination of tags and content.
    
*   **Example**:
    
    <p> This is a paragraph.</p>.
    
    is an element that includes both the opening and closing paragraph tags, as well as the text content.
    
- **Tags vs. Elements**: 
  - **Tags**: `<h1>` and `</h1>` are tags.
  - **Element**: `<h1>Hello World</h1>` (includes opening tag, content, and closing tag).
  
- **Heading Levels**: 
  - `h1` to `h6` are available, where `h1` is the largest and `h6` is the smallest.
  - No `h7` exists in HTML.
  
- **Hierarchy & Structure**: 
  - `h1` → Book title
  - `h2` → Chapter titles
  - `h3` → Sections within chapters
  - `h4` → Subsections


## Best Practices:

✅ Use only one `h1` per page.  
✅ Maintain heading order (`h1` → `h2` → `h3`, etc.).  
❌ Avoid skipping levels (e.g., jumping from `h1` to `h3`).

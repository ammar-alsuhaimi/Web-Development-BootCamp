**The Favorite Movie Project**

In this project, you're going to build a website that tracks your favorite movies. 
The idea is to create a simple webpage that lists and describes movies you love. 

Here's what you’ll need to do:

1. **Title (h1)**: Start with a main title for your site (e.g., "Top Movies of All Time According to \[Your Name\]").
2. **Subtitle (h2)**: Add a subtitle, such as "My Best 3 Movies."
3. **Horizontal Rule (hr)**: Use the <hr /> element to separate the title from the content.
4. **Movie List (h3)**: Add three movie titles, each using an <h3> element. 
For each movie, provide a short description inside a <p> tag explaining why you like the movie.
5. **Customizable**: After the basic structure is done, you’re encouraged to modify the website further. 
You can add more movies, styles, or even creative elements like break lines<br /> or a poem about a favorite movie.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

- **Title and Subtitle**: Use <h1> for the website’s title and <h2> for a subtitle.
- **Horizontal Rule**: Add an <hr/> to separate the title section from the content.
- **Movie Listings**: Use three <h3> elements for each movie and a <p> tag to describe each movie.

- **Example**:
  - **Movie 1**: Spirited Away (Favorite Anime)
  - **Movie 2**: Ex Machina (Sci-Fi Thrill)
  - **Movie 3**: Drive (Beautifully Shot)

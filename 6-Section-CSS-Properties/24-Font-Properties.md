**Font Styling in CSS**

**Font Size (font-size)**

- **Pixels (px)**: A fixed size, typically small (1px ≈ 0.26mm).
- **Points (pt)**: A unit slightly larger than pixels (1pt ≈ 0.35mm). Commonly used in word processors like Microsoft Word.
- **em**: A relative size, where 1em equals the width of the letter "M". It scales based on the parent element's font size.
- **rem**: A relative size based on the root (HTML) element's font size, offering more consistency than em.

**Font Weight (font-weight)**

- Controls the thickness of the font. Can be set to "normal" or "bold", or use values from 100 (light) to 900 (bold).
- Adjusting with relative terms (e.g., lighter, bolder) increases or decreases thickness by 100 units.

**Font Family (font-family)**

- Defines the typeface for text. Often includes a generic fallback font for compatibility (e.g., Helvetica, sans-serif).
- **Web Fonts**: Custom fonts can be used by linking to services like Google Fonts (e.g., <link> tag for importing).

**Text Alignment (text-align)**

- Aligns text with options like left, right, center, or justify.
- start and end provide more flexibility for different writing directions (e.g., left-to-right or right-to-left).

- **Key steps**:
  - Use relative units like rem for consistent, scalable font sizes.
  - Apply custom fonts from Google Fonts, ensuring fallback options are included for compatibility.

Your capstone project looks like a great opportunity to showcase your skills! Since you'll be using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS, you'll get hands-on practice with the tools you’ve been learning. Here’s a suggested approach to each step:

### Hour 0: Planning
- **Wireframes & Mockups**: Design the layout for the homepage, post creation page, edit page, and any other views you plan to include.
- **Routing**: Plan routes like `/`, `/new`, `/edit/:id`, `/delete/:id`.
- **Post Structure**: Think about what information a post will need (e.g., title, body, author).

### Hour 1: Setup
- Initialize the project with `npm init`.
- Install Express, EJS, and any other dependencies you need.
- Set up a basic Express server that can serve your EJS views.
- Create folders for routes, views, and static files like CSS.

### Hour 2-3: Implement Features
- **Post Creation**: Create a form where users can input a title and content, and then add it to the "posts" array in memory.
- **Post Viewing**: Display all posts dynamically by looping over an array of posts and injecting them into the view.
- **Post Editing**: Implement a form that allows users to update a post’s title and content.
- **Post Deleting**: Add a delete button next to each post to remove it from the array.

### Hour 4-5: Styling & Polishing
- Style the app using a CSS framework (Bootstrap is great for rapid development), or create custom CSS.
- Test responsiveness to ensure it works on different devices.
- Polish the UI, adding details like hover effects on buttons, user-friendly forms, and good typography.

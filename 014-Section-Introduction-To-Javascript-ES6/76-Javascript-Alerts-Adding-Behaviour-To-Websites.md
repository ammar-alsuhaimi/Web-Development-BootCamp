1. **JavaScript Basics**
    - JavaScript allows us to add behavior to websites, like showing pop-ups (alerts).
    - You can start writing JavaScript directly in Chrome’s JavaScript Console to test and run code.
2. **Using Chrome Developer Tools**
    - **Open Console**: Go to View > Developer > JavaScript Console in Chrome to run JavaScript directly.
    - Example code:
    - alert("Hello");

This will display a pop-up with the message "Hello".

1. **Writing Multi-line Code in Console**
    - To write multi-line code, use Shift + Enter to move to the next line.
    - Example of two pop-ups:
    - alert("Hello");
    - alert("World");
2. **Using Snippets for Code**
    - Instead of typing line-by-line in the console, use the **Snippets** section in Chrome's Developer Tools (under Sources > Snippets).
    - Create a new snippet (e.g., index.js) and write your JavaScript code there.
    - After writing the full script, click **Run** to execute the code all at once.
3. **Common Errors in JavaScript**
    - If you use a non-existent function (e.g., say("Hello")), you’ll get an error like:
    - Uncaught ReferenceError: say is not defined
    - The browser doesn't know what say is, since it's not a valid JavaScript function. You must use predefined functions like alert.
4. **MDN Web Docs**
    - **MDN Web Docs** is a great resource to understand JavaScript functions and methods.
    - Example: The alert() function is documented on MDN, where you can learn its syntax and usage.
5. **Understanding JavaScript Syntax**
    - **Functions**: Keywords like alert are predefined functions that perform specific actions.
    - **Grammar**: JavaScript has syntax rules like using parentheses () for functions, quotation marks " for strings, and semicolons ; to end statements.
6. **Best Practices in JavaScript Syntax**
    - Avoid extra spaces between elements in the code.
    - Use double quotes " for strings. Single quotes ' are also valid, but double quotes are preferred in JavaScript.
    - Avoid using “curly” quotes from word processors. Always use straight quotes in code editors.
7. **Consistency in Coding Style**
    - In JavaScript, code should be consistent and follow a style guide to maintain readability, especially when working on team projects.
    - **Style Guide**: A good reference for coding style is the "JavaScript Style Guide" (link provided), which helps ensure consistency in your code’s format.

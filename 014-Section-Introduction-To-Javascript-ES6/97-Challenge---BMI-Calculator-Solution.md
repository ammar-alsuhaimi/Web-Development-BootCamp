**Key Points:**

1. **BMI Formula**:
    - The BMI is calculated by dividing weight (in kilograms) by height squared (in meters).
    - The formula: BMI=weightheight2BMI = \\frac{\\text{weight}}{\\text{height}^2}
2. **Steps in the Function**:
    - You correctly defined a function called bmiCalculator that accepts weight and height as inputs.
    - Inside the function, you calculated BMI by dividing weight by height \* height or by using Math.pow(height, 2) for squaring the height.
    - You returned the BMI value, ensuring that it was calculated properly.
3. **Refining the Output**:
    - To make the result cleaner, you used Math.round() to round the BMI to a whole number. This is great for getting a more user-friendly result.

**Updated Code:**

function bmiCalculator(weight, height) {

let bmi = weight / Math.pow(height, 2); // You could also use height \* height

return Math.round(bmi); // Round to the nearest whole number

}

// Test the function

let bmi = bmiCalculator(65, 1.8); // Example: weight 65kg, height 1.8m

console.log(bmi); // Should log: 20

**Summary:**

- You correctly implemented the BMI calculation with two approaches: using multiplication (height \* height) and using Math.pow(height, 2).
- You also used Math.round() to round the result to a whole number, which makes the output easier to read.

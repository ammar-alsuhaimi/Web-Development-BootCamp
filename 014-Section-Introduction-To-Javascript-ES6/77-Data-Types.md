1. **Review of the Previous Lesson**
    - In the last lesson, we learned how to use the alert function in JavaScript to display a pop-up with a message. The message displayed in the pop-up is enclosed in **quotation marks**, which tells the browser that it is a **string**.
2. **What are Data Types?**
    - Data types are classifications that tell the computer how to handle different types of data in the program.
    - **String**: Text that is enclosed in quotation marks ("Hello"). This tells the computer to interpret the enclosed characters as a string of text.
    - **Number**: Numeric data such as 5, 23, or 100. These donâ€™t need quotation marks because they are recognized as numbers.
    - **Boolean**: A data type that represents a value that is either true or false.
3. **Working with Data Types in the Console**
    - You can perform basic operations in the console:
        - Example of addition:
        - 2 + 3

Output: 5

- - - You can also use the alert() function to display the result of an operation, like:
      - alert(2 + 3)

This will display a pop-up with the message 5.

1. **Using typeof() to Identify Data Types**
    - The typeof() function helps identify the data type of a value.
        - Example with a **number**:
        - typeof 23

Output: "number"

- - - Example with a **string**:
      - typeof "my name"

Output: "string"

- - - Example with a **boolean**:
      - typeof true

Output: "boolean"

1. **Summary of Key Data Types**
    - **String**: Represents text. Enclosed in quotation marks.
    - **Number**: Represents numeric values. No quotation marks are used.
    - **Boolean**: Represents true or false.
2. **The Importance of Data Types**
    - Understanding data types is crucial for working with different kinds of data in JavaScript, and they form the foundation of programming.

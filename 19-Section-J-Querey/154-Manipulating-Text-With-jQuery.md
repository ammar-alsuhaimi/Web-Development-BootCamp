# Manipulating Text with jQuery

To change the text of a selected element using jQuery, there are two ways to go about this.

## Changing Text Content

### Using the `.text()` Method
1. **Select an Element**: Use the `.text()` method to change the text content of the selected element.
    ```javascript
    $("h1").text("Goodbye");
    ```
    - **Result**: Changes the text of the `h1` element from "Hello" to "Goodbye".

2. **Select Multiple Elements**: When using jQuery to select elements, it selects all elements that match the selector on your web page.
    ```javascript
    $("button").text("Don't Click Me");
    ```
    - **Result**: Changes the text of all `button` elements to "Don't Click Me".

## Adding HTML Content

### Using the `.html()` Method
1. **Update Text with HTML**: Use the `.html()` method to add HTML content.
    ```javascript
    $("h1").html("<em>Goodbye</em>");
    ```
    - **Result**: Changes the text of the `h1` element to "Goodbye" with italicized emphasis.

### Difference Between `.text()` and `.html()`
- **.text()**: Interprets everything inside the parentheses as pure text, ignoring HTML tags.
- **.html()**: Interprets and applies HTML tags inside the parentheses.

## Understanding jQuery Methods
Most of the things you do with jQuery are implemented using methods and accessed through the dot notation.

- **Example**: Select an element and change its CSS:
    ```javascript
    $("h1").css("color", "green");
    ```

### Shortening Code and Reducing Repetition
- jQuery is completely written in JavaScript but has methods that shorten the code you need to write.
- It makes working with JavaScript quicker, easier, and reduces repetitive strain from typing.

## Importance of Understanding Vanilla JavaScript
Without a foundation in Vanilla JavaScript, jQuery might seem like magic. It's important to have a good understanding of JavaScript before using jQuery or any other library.

## Conclusion
By this point, you should have realized that jQuery can make your life as a developer much easier with less typing and more intuitive syntax.

Happy coding!

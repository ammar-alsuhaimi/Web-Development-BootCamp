# Incorporating jQuery into Your Website

Alright.

So I've spoken so much about how awesome jQuery is, but how can we get it and incorporate jQuery into our websites to start benefiting from all of its awesomeness?

## Getting jQuery
If you head over to [jquery.com](https://jquery.com), you can see that, just like Bootstrap, you can download all the jQuery code files through their download page, or you can simply use a CDN (Content Delivery Network).

### Using a CDN
Previously, we explained what CDNs are and how they work. For detailed information, refer back to the Bootstrap module when we talked about this in detail.

The most popular option across the web is to use Google's CDN. The beauty of using a popular CDN is that if a user has been to another website that uses the same CDN to fetch the jQuery library, they'll likely have it already cached and saved in their browser. This means that when they load up your website, they won't have to fetch a fresh copy of jQuery, giving your website a much faster load time.

We're going to be using the latest version of jQuery, 3.3.1 (or whatever the latest version is at the time).

## Creating a New Project
1. **Create a New Project Folder**: Go into your Web Development Project folder and create a new project called `jQuery`.
2. **Create Files**: Create the following files:
   - `index.html`
   - `styles.css`
   - `index.js`

### Setting Up HTML
1. **Boilerplate**: Set up your HTML boilerplate and name your website title `jQuery`.
2. **Include CSS and JavaScript**:
   - **CSS**: Link your stylesheet in the `<head>` section:
     ```html
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
     ```
   - **JavaScript**: Include your JavaScript at the end of your website just before the closing `</body>` tag:
     ```html
     <script src="index.js"></script>
     ```

### Test Your Setup
1. **CSS Test**:
   - Change the background color of your body to red in `styles.css`:
     ```css
     body {
         background-color: red;
     }
     ```
   - Open your HTML file in a browser to ensure the background color changes.

2. **JavaScript Test**:
   - Include a simple alert in `index.js` to check if it's working:
     ```javascript
     alert("Working");
     ```
   - Open your HTML file in a browser to ensure the alert appears.

### Adding HTML Elements
Add the following elements to `index.html`:
```html
<h1>Hello</h1>
<button>Click Me</button>
<button>Click Me</button>
<button>Click Me</button>
<button>Click Me</button>
<button>Click Me</button>
```

### Using jQuery
Write some jQuery to change the text color of your `h1` to red:
```javascript
$(document).ready(function() {
    $("h1").css("color", "red");
});
```

### Including jQuery
Incorporate jQuery by adding the Google CDN script tag above your JavaScript script tag:
```html
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="index.js"></script>
```

## Placement of Script Tags
- **Correct Placement**: Place the jQuery script tag above your JavaScript script tag to ensure it works correctly.
- **Head Section Caution**: Be cautious about including the CDN for the jQuery library in the head section of your website. Ensure that jQuery is fully loaded before your JavaScript code tries to access it.

### Using the `ready()` Method
Alternatively, you can use the `ready()` method to ensure jQuery is ready before your code runs:
```javascript
$(document).ready(function() {
    $("h1").css("color", "red");
});
```

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you can incorporate jQuery into your website and start using its powerful features to make your web development process smoother and more efficient. In the coming lessons, we'll dive deeper into jQuery and explore its capabilities further.

Happy coding!

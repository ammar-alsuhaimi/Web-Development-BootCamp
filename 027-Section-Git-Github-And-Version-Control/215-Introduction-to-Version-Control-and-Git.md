### What Git Does
- **Version Control**: Git allows you to save snapshots of your code at different stages. Each snapshot is known as a "commit."
- **Rollbacks**: As you mentioned, if things go wrong, Git allows you to revert to an earlier version. You can use commands like `git checkout` or `git revert` to go back to a specific commit or branch.
- **Branches**: You can create branches to work on features or experiments without affecting your main codebase. Later, you can merge them back into the main branch (usually called `main` or `master`).
- **Tracking Changes**: Git tracks changes to files and directories. You can compare versions (or commits) to see what was changed.

### Basic Git Workflow
1. **Initializing Git**: Start by initializing a repository in a folder using `git init`.
2. **Staging Changes**: When you make changes, use `git add .` to stage all changes for commit.
3. **Committing**: Save your changes with a commit using `git commit -m "Your commit message"`.
4. **Viewing History**: You can check the commit history with `git log` to see previous versions.

### Rolling Back
- **Undo Local Changes**: If you haven't committed yet, you can use `git checkout -- <filename>` to discard changes to a specific file.
- **Undo Last Commit**: If you’ve already committed but want to undo it, `git reset --hard HEAD~1` can take you back to the commit before the last one.

### Remote Repositories (GitHub)
- **Clone**: To clone a GitHub repository, use `git clone <repo-url>`.
- **Push**: Push your local changes to the remote repository with `git push`.
- **Pull**: To get the latest changes from the remote, use `git pull`.

Learning to use Git and GitHub will really help you streamline your development process. Once you start using it regularly, you’ll find it invaluable for managing your projects!

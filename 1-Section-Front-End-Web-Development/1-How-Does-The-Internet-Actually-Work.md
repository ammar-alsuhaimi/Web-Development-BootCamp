### 1. What is the Internet?
- The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers, often visualized as a long piece of wire connecting different machines around the world.

### 2. Servers and Clients
- **Servers** are computers that store and serve data, available 24/7.
- **Clients** are the computers used by individuals to access the Internet.

### 3. How Data is Requested
- When you type a website URL (e.g., google.com) into your browser, a request is sent to your ISP (Internet Service Provider).
- The ISP forwards this request to a DNS (Domain Name System) server, which acts like a phone book to look up the website's IP address.
- The DNS server returns the IP address, allowing your browser to connect directly to the website's server and retrieve the necessary data to display the website.

### 4. Undersea Cables
- The Internet is also connected via massive undersea cables that span continents, transmitting data at high speeds through fiber optic fibers.

### 5. IP Addresses
- Every computer on the Internet has a unique IP address, functioning like a postal code to locate and communicate with other machines.

### 6. Data Transmission
- Data is transmitted through electric signals that travel at the speed of light, enabling rapid access to websites and online services.

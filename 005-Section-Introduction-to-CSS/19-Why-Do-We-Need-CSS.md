**Introduction to CSS**

we explored **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**
â€” what it is, how it works, and why it's essential for web design.

**What is CSS?**

- CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**, a language used to style HTML elements.
- The term **"cascade"** refers to how styles flow from general to specific, much like a waterfall.
- CSS allows us to define colors, fonts, layouts, and other visual aspects of a webpage.

**Why Was CSS Created?**

- Early websites relied solely on **HTML**, which lacked styling capabilities.
- Developers had to use inline styling within HTML, leading to cluttered, hard-to-manage code.
- The **W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)** introduced CSS in **1996**, separating content (HTML) from design (CSS).

**Benefits of CSS**

- **Separation of concerns**: HTML handles content, while CSS manages styling.
- **Cleaner and more efficient code**: Websites become easier to maintain and update.
- **Consistency**: A single CSS file can style multiple pages, ensuring a uniform look.

**CSS in Action**

- A simple HTML website can be **transformed** with CSS by adding styles without modifying the HTML structure.
- By toggling CSS on and off, we can see the impact of styling on webpage appearance.

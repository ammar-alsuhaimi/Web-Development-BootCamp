### Building Your Own Dice Game

#### Introduction
- Utilize your knowledge of the DOM and JavaScript to create a dice game.
- The finished game will have:
  - A title: "Refresh Me"
  - Player 1 and Player 2 dice
  - A winner announcement based on dice values

#### Game Description
- Upon refreshing the website, both Player 1 and Player 2 dice values are generated randomly.
- The website announces the winner based on whose dice value is higher.
- A fun and simple game to settle disputes or family arguments.

#### Challenge
- Create this website by yourself to solidify your understanding of the DOM and JavaScript.
- The challenge helps you apply knowledge from previous lessons to a real-world project.

#### Starting Code
- The next lesson includes starting code with pre-written HTML and CSS.
- This allows you to focus on JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

#### Options for Extra Practice
- You can build the HTML and CSS from scratch if you prefer extra practice.
- Download the skeleton project and open `Dicee.html` in Chrome to see the required appearance.
- All image assets are included in the zip file.

 **Chrome Developer Tools** for **CSS inspection**. 
 
 
 Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Accessing Chrome Developer Tools**:
    - You can open the Developer Tools by pressing Ctrl + Shift + I (Windows) or Cmd + Option + I (Mac), or by right-clicking on an element and selecting "Inspect".
    - You can also use the "Inspect" button to select elements visually.
2. **Inspecting and Modifying CSS**:
    - In the **Elements tab**, you can view and edit the CSS applied to elements.
    - Changes made in the Developer Tools are temporary and don't affect the original files. They are only visible in your local browser session.
3. **Using the "Styles" Section**:
    - The **Styles section** shows which CSS rules are applied and allows you to toggle or add new styles.
    - You can see conflicting rules (e.g., when multiple rules affect the same property), and the **Computed tab** will give you the final computed value (e.g., RGB color values).
4. **Other Tools**:
    - The **CSS Overview** tool lets you capture an overview of a webpage's styles, including colors, fonts, and background details.

The main takeaway is how to use the Developer Tools to inspect and manipulate CSS, troubleshoot issues, and explore how CSS is applied to a webpage.

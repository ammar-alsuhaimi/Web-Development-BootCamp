Step 7 - Start the Game
1. Use jQuery to detect when a keyboard key has been pressed, when that happens for the first time, call nextSequence().

You'll need a way to keep track of whether if the game has started or not, so you only call nextSequence() on the first keypress.

2. Create a new variable called level and start at level 0.

3. The h1 title starts out saying "Press A Key to Start", when the game has started, change this to say "Level 0".

4. Inside nextSequence(), increase the level by 1 every time nextSequence() is called.

5. Inside nextSequence(), update the h1 with this change in the value of level.

All going well, this is what you should see when you refresh the website:

Hint 1. You'll need a variable called started to toggle to true once the game starts and if it's true, then further key presses should not trigger nextSequence().

Hint 3. The h1 has a unique id of level-title which you can target with jQuery.

Hint 5.  You'll need to use jQuery again to change the h1 by targeting the id: level-title.

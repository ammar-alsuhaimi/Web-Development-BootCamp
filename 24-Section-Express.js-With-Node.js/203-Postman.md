1. **HTTP Communication**: HTTP requests are how client-side applications (e.g., browsers) communicate with server-side applications (e.g., APIs). Requests can be sent using various methods like GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

2. **HTTP Status Codes**: 
   - **200 (OK)**: Successful request.
   - **201 (Created)**: Successful POST or PUT request where a resource is created.
   - **404 (Not Found)**: Client made an incorrect request (wrong URL).
   - **500 (Server Error)**: Issue on the server side.

3. **Using Postman for Testing**: 
   - Postman allows you to send requests to a server without needing a front-end. It's especially useful for testing POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests without needing to set up full front-end code.
   - The interface allows you to select request types, specify endpoints, and add data to the body of requests.
   - You can also easily view the response, which includes status codes and returned data.

4. **HTTP Methods**:
   - **GET**: Fetches data from the server.
   - **POST**: Sends data to the server, often used for creating new resources.
   - **PUT**: Replaces a resource with new data.
   - **PATCH**: Partially updates a resource.
   - **DELETE**: Deletes a resource.

5. **Practical Exercise**: You're encouraged to test the different HTTP methods using Postman. The goal is to check that each request type returns the appropriate status code and that the server responds as expected.

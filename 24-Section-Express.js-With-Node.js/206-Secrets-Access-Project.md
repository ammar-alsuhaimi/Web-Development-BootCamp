This project is a great way to bring together all the concepts you've learned about Node.js and Express. The goal is to create a website with a secret page that can only be accessed if the user provides the correct password. Here's a breakdown of how you can approach the project and the code involved:

### Steps:
1. **Setup and Dependencies**:
   - Download and extract the course resources.
   - Run `npm install` to install `express` and `body-parser` (you can skip `body-parser` if you're using the built-in functionality from Express).
   - Open the `index.js` file (it’s where you’ll write all your server-side code).

2. **Structure**:
   - The `public` folder contains the static HTML files:
     - `index.html` for the homepage with a form where users can input a password.
     - `secrets.html` that will be shown to the user if they enter the correct password.

3. **Setting up the Server**:
   - Create an Express app and use `body-parser` to parse incoming form data.
   - Define a `userIsAuthorized` flag to track if a user has entered the correct password.

4. **Password Check Middleware**:
   - Create a middleware function to check the password entered by the user. 
   - If the password is correct, the middleware will allow the request to proceed (using `next()`) and mark the user as authenticated.
   - If the password is wrong, redirect the user back to the homepage.

5. **Routes**:
   - Set up a `GET` route for the homepage (`/`) that sends the `index.html` file.
   - Set up a `POST` route (`/check`) to handle the form submission. This route will check if the user is authorized. If they are, send them to `secrets.html`; otherwise, redirect them back to the homepage.

### Sample Code:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const path = require('path');

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Middleware
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

let userIsAuthorized = false;

// Password check middleware
const passwordCheck = (req, res, next) => {
  const enteredPassword = req.body.password;
  if (enteredPassword === 'ILoveProgramming') {
    userIsAuthorized = true;
  }
  next();
};

// Routes
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'public', 'index.html'));
});

app.post('/check', passwordCheck, (req, res) => {
  if (userIsAuthorized) {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'public', 'secrets.html'));
  } else {
    res.redirect('/');
  }
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
});
```

### Explanation:
- The middleware `passwordCheck` looks for the password entered in the form and checks if it matches `"ILoveProgramming"`. If it does, the user is considered authorized.
- The `/` route serves the `index.html` page, and the `/check` route handles the form submission and checks if the user is authorized. If they are, they’re sent to `secrets.html`; otherwise, they’re redirected to the homepage.

### Key Notes:
- **Express** handles routing and server setup.
- **body-parser** (or Express's built-in functionality) helps parse the form data.
- **Redirects**: `res.redirect()` is used to redirect the user if the password is incorrect.
- **Security**: This simple implementation is not suitable for real-world applications, but it's great for learning how the server handles user authentication.

If you haven't tried this out yet, I recommend following along and implementing it yourself. 
You'll learn a lot from the process of figuring things out! Let me know if you run into any issues or need further clarification on any part.

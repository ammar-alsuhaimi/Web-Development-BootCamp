# Express Framework

## Introduction

In this lesson, we're going to be learning all about the **Express Framework**, the framework built on top of **Node.js** that helps us create our backends with ease.

Even among all backend frameworks, **Express ranks highly** among professional developers. We will explore what this framework is and why it is so widely used.

## Node.js vs. Express

Previously, we mentioned that many programming languages can be used on the backend. However, aside from languages, there are also various **frameworks** to choose from.

I previously mentioned that **Node.js** is the framework that uses JavaScript, but to be more accurate, **Node.js is not a frameworkâ€”it's a runtime environment**.

A **runtime environment** allows us to run JavaScript **outside of the browser**, making it possible to use JavaScript on a computer directly.

On the other hand, **Express.js is a JavaScript framework** that helps us create backends for websites. The combination of **Node.js and Express** is how most professional developers build their website backends.

## Why Do We Need Express?

**Node.js is very powerful and versatile**â€”it enables JavaScript to run on any computer and can be used for many things beyond web development, such as:

- Programming **IoT devices** (e.g., a smart toaster that tweets when your toast is ready!)
- Developing **desktop applications** (e.g., **VS Code** is built using Node.js)

When a tool allows for many different applications, it **may not be optimized for any single task**. Since our goal is **creating a website backend**, we need something **specialized**â€”and thatâ€™s where **Express.js** comes in.

### The IKEA Analogy

Imagine **Node.js** as a **Phillips screwdriver**â€”a general-purpose tool. It's great for many tasks, but not always the most efficient choice.

If you've ever built IKEA furniture, you know the struggle of using an **Allen key** or **manual screwdriver**. If you're assembling a complex piece like a **PAX wardrobe** or a **BILLY bookcase**, you'll eventually **buy an electric screwdriver**â€”and suddenly, everything becomes **faster and easier**.

ðŸ”§ In this analogy, **Express.js is the electric screwdriver**â€”it makes backend development with Node.js **simpler, quicker, and more efficient**.

## Express vs. Plain Node.js

Letâ€™s compare writing backend code **with and without Express**.

### Using Only Node.js

To create a simple website with a homepage and an "About Us" page using only Node.js, you would have to write **a lot of code**. The result is:

- **Cumbersome**
- **Hard to read**
- **Difficult to maintain**

### Using Express.js

Now, let's look at the same website **built with Express**.

- **Cleaner** and **more readable** code
- **Modular** structure, making it easier to understand
- **Less code to write**
- **Built-in middleware support** (explained soon)

Developers **never** create websites using just Node.jsâ€”**they use Express**.

## Advantages of Express.js

- **Better readability**
- **Less boilerplate code**
- **Middleware support** (allows for easy modular functionality)
- **Better developer experience**
- **Adopted by the vast majority of JavaScript backend developers**

## Popularity of Express.js

JavaScript developers constantly debate **the best frontend and backend frameworks**. However, when it comes to **backend development with Node.js**, **Express.js is the clear winner**.

According to **The State of JavaScript** statistics, **Express.js is the dominant choice** for Node.js backend development.

## Next Steps

Now that we know **what Express.js is and why professionals use it**, the next step is to **build our first backend using Express.js**.

Stay tuned for the next lesson, where we'll **set up Express.js and create a simple backend!** ðŸš€

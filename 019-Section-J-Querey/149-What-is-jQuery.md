# Introduction to jQuery

Alright guys,

In this module, I want to introduce you to the most popular JavaScript library—**jQuery**.

There are thousands of JavaScript libraries out there, and in later modules, we'll explore some of these libraries, but none have been used or downloaded as often as jQuery. So, why is that?

## Why jQuery?

Let's take a look at some code we've written before. Essentially, what it's doing is:
1. **Querying the Document**:
   - Looking inside the entire document.
   - Querying for all elements with the selector `button` (all HTML button elements).
2. **Adding Event Listeners**:
   - Adding an event listener to detect clicks on the buttons.
   - When a click is detected, running the callback function to query the document for the selector `h1`.
3. **Changing Styles**:
   - Changing the style (color) of the `h1` element to red.
4. **Using a For Loop**:
   - Traversing through all the buttons on our web page to add this event listener and behavior to all of them.

Here's what that looks like in pure JavaScript:
```javascript
var buttons = document.querySelectorAll("button");
for (var i = 0; i < buttons.length; i++) {
    buttons[i].addEventListener("click", function() {
        document.querySelector("h1").style.color = "red";
    });
}
```

It's a bit crazy how many lines of code are required to do something relatively simple. 

## Enter John Resig
John Resig, unhappy with the complexity of JavaScript in web development, decided to write a library that would simplify this process. And so, jQuery was born.

## What is jQuery?
jQuery is a library—a bunch of code that someone else wrote that you can incorporate into your own projects to:
- Improve your projects.
- Make your life easier.

We've used libraries before, like **Bootstrap**, to make our lives easier by improving the user interface of our websites quickly.

## Simplifying with jQuery
Here's how jQuery simplifies the code:
```javascript
jQuery("h1").css("color", "red");
```
Or even shorter:
```javascript
$("h1").css("color", "red");
```
- `$` is the shorthand way to write jQuery.
- This does exactly the same as `document.querySelector("h1").style.color = "red";`.

You can see that it's a lot shorter, making our JavaScript code:
- Easier to read.
- Easier to debug.
- Faster to write, saving us from typing so much JavaScript code.

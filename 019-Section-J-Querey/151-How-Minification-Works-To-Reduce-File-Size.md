# How Minification Works to Reduce File Size

For the inquisitive ones among you, you might have copied the URL where our jQuery library resides and tried to take a look at it. If you did, this is what you would seeâ€”it looks like a huge mess.

## What is Minification?

This is essentially the minified version of the jQuery library. You might notice that it looks very similar to the Bootstrap CDN that we used previously. When you copy the URL and load it in your browser, you see a huge mess of code.

### Why Minify Code?

Minification removes all spaces, new lines, and comments from the file to reduce its size. Let's take a section of this minified code and break it down.

### Example of Minification

#### Original Code:
```javascript
// This is a comment
function sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
}
sayHello();
```

#### Minified Code:
```javascript
function sayHello(){console.log("Hello, world!")}sayHello();
```

You can see that the same JavaScript code has been compressed into a single line. This process removes unnecessary characters, making the file smaller and quicker to load.

### Using a Minifier Tool

Visit [minifier.org](https://www.minifier.org) to convert your JavaScript or CSS code into a minified version. Here's how:

1. Copy the original code from your project.
2. Paste it into the minifier tool.
3. Select the appropriate option (JavaScript or CSS) and hit "Minify".

#### Example:
- **Original Script Size**: 1539 bytes
- **Minified Script Size**: 1113 bytes
- **Size Reduction**: 426 bytes

This reduction makes the files smaller and quicker for users to load.

### Benefits of Minification

1. **Faster Load Times**: Minified files load faster because they are smaller in size.
2. **No Unnecessary Information**: Browsers don't care about tabs, indents, spaces, or comments. Minification removes these, making the website load faster.

### Standard vs. Minified Versions

When you download the jQuery library, you'll get both a standard version (human-readable) and a minified version (optimized for browsers). You can customize the standard version and then minify it yourself, or you can use the minified version directly.

## Conclusion

In the next lesson, we'll get hands-on with jQuery and explore all the things you can do with it, starting with selecting elements. Stay tuned for more!

Happy coding!

# Getting Started with the Terminal

The first thing you're going to do is open up your terminal.

## Customizing Your Terminal

You might notice that my terminal's preferences or display (the "skin") look different from yours. I use a green-on-black color scheme because it helps my eyes during late-night development sessions and aids my sleep afterwards. Plus, when you're scripting in a café, it adds a cool "hacker" vibe!

## First Command: `ls`

Let's start with the `ls` command, which stands for "list." This command lists all items in a directory.

### Example: Listing Items

To see where you are in the directory structure, look at the prompt. The tilde (`~`) indicates you're in your user directory, similar to this path in Finder: 
```
/Macintosh HD/Users/[YourUsername]/
```
To list items:
```bash
ls
```
This prints all folders and files in the current directory.

## Navigating Directories with `cd`

To navigate to different directories, use the `cd` (change directory) command.

### Example: Changing Directory

If you're in your user directory and want to go to the Documents folder:
```bash
cd Documents
```
You can use the Tab key for auto-completion:
- Type `Doc` and press Tab to complete "Documents."
- If there's ambiguity (e.g., "Documents" and "Downloads"), type enough characters to make it unique and press Tab again.

To navigate into the "Learn" folder within Documents:
```bash
cd Learn
```

### Navigating Multiple Levels

You can specify the entire path to navigate multiple levels:
```bash
cd Documents/Learn/Languages
```

### Using Up and Down Arrows

Use the up (↑) and down (↓) arrows to cycle through previous commands:
- Press ↑ to retrieve the last command.
- Press ↓ to move to newer commands.

### Going Back to Previous Directory

To go back to the previous directory (parent folder):
```bash
cd ..
```
Repeat this command to move up multiple levels.

### Time-Saving Tips

- **Option/Alt + Click**: Move the cursor to a specific position in a command.
- **Ctrl + A**: Move the cursor to the beginning of the line.
- **Ctrl + E**: Move the cursor to the end of the line.
- **Ctrl + U**: Clear the current command line.

## Conclusion

In the next lesson, we'll cover directories, making directories, and secret folders. See you there!

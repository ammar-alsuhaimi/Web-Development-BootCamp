# Installing Node.js on Mac

## Installation Steps

1. **Download the Mac installer** from the [Node.js® website](https://nodejs.org/).
    - Choose the Long Term Support version that’s shown on the left.

2. **Run the installer** (double-click on the `.pkg` file you downloaded in the previous step).
    - **NOTE**: If you are running macOS Catalina 10.15, you might get a warning pop-up that looks like this:
        - To solve this issue, just right-click (hold down the control key on the keyboard and click) on the `.pkg` file and select "Open With" and then select "Installer (default)".

3. **Follow the prompts in the installer**:
    - Accept the license agreement.
    - Click the NEXT button a bunch of times.
    - Accept the default installation settings.

4. **Confirm that Node.js has been installed successfully**:
    - Open a Hyper terminal.
    - Enter the command:
    ```sh
    node --version
    ```
    - You should see the version of Node.js you have just installed.

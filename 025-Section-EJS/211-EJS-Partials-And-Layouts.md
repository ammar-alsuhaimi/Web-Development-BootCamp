In this lesson, you're learning how to use **Partials in EJS** to reduce code repetition across multiple pages in a web application. Here's a detailed breakdown of the key concepts covered:

### 1. **Difference Between Static and Dynamic Files**
   - **Static Files** (e.g., CSS, images, and JavaScript) are files that do not change and can be served directly to the browser. These are placed in a public folder within the project.
   - **Dynamic Files** (e.g., EJS templates) are processed by the server to generate HTML dynamically before being sent to the browser.
   - In an Express.js app, static files are served using `express.static()`, which tells Express where to look for non-changing resources (like your CSS files, images, etc.).

### 2. **Setting Up Static Files**
   - You have to tell Express where your **public folder** is (which contains your static files). You do this with middleware like:
     ```javascript
     app.use(express.static('public'));
     ```
   - The **public folder** contains assets like images and stylesheets, and files inside it can be referenced relatively from your EJS templates. For example:
     ```html
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/layout.css">
     ```
     Here, `/styles/layout.css` is a relative path to a CSS file located inside the **public** folder.

### 3. **Introducing Partials**
   - Partials in EJS help reduce code repetition across multiple pages. For example, you may have a **header** and a **footer** that appear on every page.
   - Instead of writing the header and footer code in each individual EJS file, you can **include** them using the `include` EJS tag:
     ```html
     <%- include('partials/header') %>
     <%- include('partials/footer') %>
     ```
     This includes the contents of the `header.ejs` and `footer.ejs` files into your current EJS file.

### 4. **Setting Up Routes for Multi-Page Websites**
   - For a multi-page website, you handle multiple **GET requests**. For example, clicking on a "Contact" or "About" link in the navbar sends a GET request to `/contact` or `/about` respectively.
   - You create routes in your server to handle these requests and render the corresponding EJS views:
     ```javascript
     app.get('/about', (req, res) => {
       res.render('about');
     });
     app.get('/contact', (req, res) => {
       res.render('contact');
     });
     ```

### 5. **Adding Partials to Other Pages**
   - After creating the routes for your pages, you can add the `include` tags in the relevant EJS files (like `about.ejs` or `contact.ejs`) to ensure the header and footer are included:
     ```html
     <%- include('partials/header') %>
     <h1>About Us</h1>
     <%- include('partials/footer') %>
     ```

### 6. **Goal of the Exercise**
   - The goal was to:
     1. **Render the home page** correctly.
     2. Set up the **static files** so they load properly (like CSS).
     3. Add routes for the **About** and **Contact** pages and make them accessible via navigation.
     4. **Use Partials** to avoid repeating the header and footer on each page.

### 7. **Final Thoughts**
   - By using **partials** in EJS, you keep your code clean and avoid redundancy. Instead of writing the same HTML (for the header, footer, etc.) in every file, you include it once in a shared location.
   - Using **static files** ensures that assets like stylesheets and images are served efficiently without having to dynamically generate them.

### Solution Walkthrough:
1. **Render the Home Page**: The root route renders `index.ejs`.
2. **Use `express.static()`**: To serve static files from the `public` folder.
3. **Add Routes**: Create GET routes for `/about` and `/contact` to render the respective EJS pages.
4. **Add Partials**: Include the header and footer in each EJS page using the `include` tag.

### Conclusion
By using **partials**, you save time and reduce clutter in your templates. This practice makes your code more maintainable and scalable, especially as your web application grows.
